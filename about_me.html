                    For some background, I'm an undergrad student pursuing a computer science degree.
                    I have some pretty passive experience with coding and computers and just building things in general (Lego Mindstorms Represent!), but I haven't focused any of my abilities into something specific until now. 
                    Besides a few throwaway projects, my background is pretty sparse. This is where this blog comes in!<br>

                    Right now I'm pursuing a career in Cybersecurity. This blog is going to help me document my processes for certain projects, and give me a platform to talk about my learned skills to anyone who might be willing to listen. 
                    To anyone who's still reading, I'm so happy to have you here!
