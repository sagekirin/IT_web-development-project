# IT_web-development-project

This is a project for my web development class that maybe sort of accidentally turned into a personal blog. It's meant to act like a playground for HTML, CSS, JS, etc, and trying new things out. Heavily inspired by blogs on Neocities.

There is a link to the neocities page, however everything may not render as intended. Until I figure out a fix, you'll most likely need to download the files yourself and run them on your machine.
Have a look around! Also borrow some of my code if you want, but please do not outright copy my page. If you have any questions or just want to talk, shoot me a message! I'm almost always available for a chat ^^
